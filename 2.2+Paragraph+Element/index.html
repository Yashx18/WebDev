<h1>Berserk</h1>
<p>Guts was born from a hanged corpse and raised as a mercenary by his abusive adoptive father, Gambino, following the death of his adoptive mother, Shisu. After being forced to kill Gambino in self-defense, Guts fled his mercenary group and became a wandering mercenary. His reputation attracts the attention of Griffith, the leader of a mercenary group called the Band of the Hawk, which he makes Guts join after defeating him. The kingdom of Midland hires the Band to aid them in their war against the Chuder Empire, and Guts learns of Griffith's desire to rule his own kingdom and of the pendant he possesses, called the Behelit. After Nosferatu Zodd spares them, he warns Guts that he will die for being Griffith's friend.

    As Griffith befriends Midland's nobility and the king's daughter, Charlotte, Guts begins to develop feelings for Casca. After overhearing Griffith confess to Charlotte that he only considers someone with their own dream as a friend, Guts decides to leave the group to find his own dream, a decision that sends Griffith into a downward spiral that culminates in his arrest after he seduces Charlotte. He loses the Behelit while being subjected to torture, and the Midland army declares the Hawks as criminals. Soon after, a mysterious being known as the Skull Knight warns Guts that his actions have triggered an Eclipse and, after learning of the Hawks' predicament, he rejoins them to rescue Griffith.
    
    After rescuing Griffith, the Hawks learn that his torture has left him incapable of leading them. When Griffith regains his Behelit, it uses his blood to initiate the Eclipse, a convergence of the physical and astral realms. During the Eclipse, the Hawks encounter a quartet of archdemons known as the Godhand, who reveal that Griffith has been chosen as their fifth member and can only do so if he sacrifices his comrades, which he accepts. After being branded with sigils that mark them for sacrifice, the Hawks are slaughtered by the Godhand's Apostles—humans who, like Zodd, gained power by sacrificing their loved ones—and only Guts and Casca survive. Griffith, who has become the fifth Godhand, Femto, rapes Casca, and Guts loses his left forearm and right eye while trying to save her; although the Skull Knight rescues them, the ordeal traumatizes Casca. After learning from the Skull Knight that the Brands of Sacrifice make them targets for beings of darkness, Guts leaves Casca in the care of the blacksmith Godo, his adoptive daughter Erica, and Rickert, the youngest member of the Band of the Hawk, who survived because he was not present at the Eclipse. After Godo gives Guts a new sword, Dragonslayer, and Rickert gives him a prosthetic left arm, Guts begins hunting the Apostles while being pursued by the Demon Infant, which is revealed to be his and Casca's unborn child that became deformed after Femto raped her.
    
    Two years later, having killed many Apostles and become known as the Black Swordsman, Guts is joined by the elf Puck, but they are captured by Farnese, the captain of the Holy See Church's Holy Iron Chain Knights, who believes that Guts is a harbinger of the apocalypse. Guts escapes after saving Farnese and returns home to Godo, where he learns that Casca has wandered off. His search for her takes him to the ruined city of St. Albion, which the Godhand have prepared as the site for a ceremony to give one of their own a physical form and which has become a refuge for refugees fleeing the Kushan Empire's armies. Guts saves Casca from the Holy See bishop Mozgus as the souls of the dead attack the city and is joined by Farnese, her bodyguard Serpico, and the young thief Isidro. Meanwhile, an Apostle living under St. Albion consumes the Demon Infant and uses its body to restore Griffith to physical form.
    
    After Guts fights Griffith and Zodd at Godo's home, Griffith realizes that some traces of the Demon Infant remain within him. Hoping to find a land safe from the demons, Guts decides to travel with Casca to Puck's homeland of Elfhelm on the island of Skellig, allowing Isidro, Farnese, and Serpico to follow him out of fear that he will lose control of himself to his dark impulses, which are embodied as the Beast of Darkness within his mind, with Farnese becoming Casca's primary caretaker. Meanwhile, Griffith forms a second Band of the Hawk with Zodd and other Apostles to save Midland from the Kushan Empire, which is led by their emperor Ganishka, a rogue Apostle.
    
    Guts' party encounters the witch Flora and her apprentice Schierke while saving a village from trolls, and Flora gives him the Berserker Armor, which increases his power but risks pushing his body beyond its limits and being consumed by his inner darkness. Flora is later killed, and after escaping, Guts' party encounters the Moonlight Child, who expresses affection for Guts and Casca before disappearing after the full moon passes. Meanwhile, the Skull Knight warns Guts to not abuse the Berserker Armor's power while assuring him that Elfhelm's inhabitants can heal Casca's mind. While Guts and his party secure a ship called the "Seahorse", which is captained by Farnese's fiance, Prince Roderick, to reach Elfhelm, the Emperor transforms and causes the physical and astral realms to merge. With the blessing of Charlotte and the Holy See, Griffith establishes the city of Falconia to provide refuge for the Midlanders and humanity from the creatures that manifested after the realms merged.
    
    After recruiting a merrow girl named Isma, Guts' party reaches Elfhelm; its elf ruler, Danann, helps Farnese and Schierke begin a training, and succeed in restoring Casca's mind. The Skull Knight introduces Guts to the creator of the Berserker Armor and reveals his past with the Godhand and its leader, Void. The Moonlight Child later reappears; it is revealed that he is the Demon Infant, who can take control of Griffith's host during a full moon. Griffith regains control of his host and abducts Casca while destroying the island's spirit tree, unleashing spirits that attack the island and causing Danann, Isma, and the other magical creatures (except for Puck and Ivalera) to disappear into the Astral Realm. As the survivors flee on the Seahorse, Guts breaks down in despair. Griffith returns to the mainland with Casca, heading to Falconia, where she remembers her companions and attempts to escape, only to lose consciousness. Guts is taunted by visions of his inner darkness that urge him to give in, but he passes out as Kushan warriors invade the ship and are revealed to be under the command of Silat, the leader of the Bakiraka warrior clan, and Daiba, a magician and former servant of Ganishka. Among the soldiers is Rickert, who had escaped from Falconia along with the Kushan deserters.
    
    The Kushan escort Guts and the rest of the party to their capital and Guts is imprisoned. Daiba informs them that Falconia's army has appeared on the borders of the Kushan Empire and that the attack on Elfhelm is part of a wider campaign by Falconia to have Griffith rule the world. As such, Daiba orders that Guts and his party, Rodrick, the ships' crew, and Elfhelm's surviving sorcerers be placed under his command as the empire prepares for war with Falconia.</p>
